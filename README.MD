I am putting all my custom flogo components here.

Currently the activity/inference is the same one as that in flogo-contrib except that it has been modified to only load a model once (an if statement to see if it is already loaded) and it is modified to accept the smartmapper model.  -20180807

I have included an app "Smart Mapper" for mapping SF labels to Marketo Labels.
